## To backup project folders to external drive:

(base) conrad@conrad-Precision-Tower-3620:~$ rsync -av /home/conrad/ecoli_all /media/conrad/New\ Volume

# Note: do not put slashes "/" after directory name to copy entire directory; putting the slash makes rsync copy the files within that directory...so the external drive will end up with a bunch of files not in a project folder.

# Note: Add '--delete' the command above to remove deleted files from the backup.
