## Get number of reads from fastq file:
awk '{s++}END{print s/4}' <fastq file>

## Get the % reads mapping to genus for each report file from Kraken2 in the format:
	<filename>
	<% reads mapping & other info>
for i in *.txt; do echo $i; grep '<genus>' $i | head -n 1; done
## Related to getting the first # occurrence(s) of pattern using grep for small files:
grep 'pattern' | head -n #

## Get # reads and # bases in fastq file:
fix_base_count() {
    local counts=($(cat))
    echo "${counts[0]} $((${counts[1]} - ${counts[0]}))"
}

gzip -dc ERR047740_1.filt.fastq.gz \
    | awk 'NR % 4 == 2' \
    | wc -cl \
    | fix_base_count

## Get fastq from sam file:
cat samplename.nomapping.sam | grep -v ^@ | awk 'NR%2==1 {print "@"$1"\n"$10"\n+\n"$11}' > unmapped/samplename_1.fastq # R1 
cat samplename.nomapping.sam | grep -v ^@ | awk 'NR%2==0 {print "@"$1"\n"$10"\n+\n"$11}' > unmapped/samplename_2.fastq # R2

# grep -v ^@ removes the SAM header lines
# NR%2==1 executes on only the odd-numbered rows (this is to split paired-end output â€“ my input SAM file is name-sorted, so paired # reads occupy consecutive lines)
# NR%2==0 executes on only the even-numbered rows
# "@"$1"\n"$10"\n+\n"$11 grabs the read name ($1), read ($10), and base quality scores ($11) and writes them out per the FASTQ spec



## Rename fasta headers from whatever they are to sequentially numbered:
## e.g. from >long_fasta_header to >1
awk '/^>/{print ">" ++i; next}{print}' < fasta.file

## Change home directory ownership after re-installing Ubuntu (which I have had to do a million times):
conrad@conrad-Precision-Tower-3620:~$ sudo chown -R $USER /home/conrad/

## Use bioawk get multi-fasta (and single fasta) seq lengths:
bioawk -c fastx '{print $name length($seq)}' input.fasta

## Convert phylip to fasta using BBMap phylip2fasta:
~/software/bbmap/phylip2fasta.sh in=./st12_vs_5585_snps.phylip out=st12_vs_5585_snps.fasta

## Split multi-fasta to sequentially numbered individual fasta files:
(gubbins-env) conrad@conrad-Precision-Tower-3620:~/hinfluenzae/snvphyl_testing$ awk '/^>/{s=++d".fasta"} {print > s}' PMEN1.aln
