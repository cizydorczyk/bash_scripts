## Get number of reads from fastq file:
awk '{s++}END{print s/4}' <fastq file>

## Get the % reads mapping to genus for each report file from Kraken2 in the format:
	<filename>
	<% reads mapping & other info>
for i in *.txt; do echo $i; grep '<genus>' $i | head -n 1; done
## Related to getting the first # occurrence(s) of pattern using grep for small files:
grep 'pattern' | head -n #

## Get # reads and # bases in fastq file:
fix_base_count() {
    local counts=($(cat))
    echo "${counts[0]} $((${counts[1]} - ${counts[0]}))"
}
